## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

Your code needs to be on GitHub for Render to access it.

```bash
# Add a GitHub remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Add and commit any changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update analytics styling and prepare for Render deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)** and sign in
2. **Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Configure the service:**

   - **Name:** `supreme-one-api`
   - **Region:** Choose closest to your users
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Root Directory:** `api`
   - **Runtime:** Node
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Instance Type:** Free (or upgrade for better performance)

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

In Render dashboard, add these environment variables:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key from api/.env file |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | Your email password from api/.env file |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `CALENDLY_URL` | `https://calendly.com/sarahai-supremeone/30min` |

2. Render will automatically build and deploy
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for the first deployment
4. You'll get a URL like: `https://supreme-one-api.onrender.com`
