## 🚀 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. **Add Screenshots** (Optional but Recommended)
You have folders with screenshots from the actual platform:
- `/Dashboard` - Dashboard screenshots
- `/Deals` - Deal analysis interface
- `/Reports` - Reporting screens
- `/Role Play` - Roleplay interface
- `/Tutorials` - Tutorial pages
- `/Welcome` - Welcome screens

**To add them:**
```bash
# Copy screenshots to images folder
cp Dashboard/*.png images/
cp "Role Play"/*.png images/
# etc.

# Then update HTML image paths in the preview sections
```

### 2. **Deploy to supremeone.net**

**Option A: Netlify (Recommended - Free & Easy)**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
cd /Users/seanmcnally/Desktop/SupremeOne-website
netlify deploy --prod

# Follow prompts to:
# 1. Connect to your Netlify account
# 2. Add custom domain: supremeone.net
# 3. Netlify provides free SSL certificate
```

**Option B: GitHub Pages (Free)**
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Supreme One website"

# Push to GitHub and enable Pages in settings
```

**Option C: Traditional Hosting (cPanel, etc.)**
- Upload all files via FTP to your web root
- Ensure file permissions are correct

### 3. **Set Up Contact Form**

The contact form needs a backend. Choose one:

**FormSpree (Easiest - Free):**
1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Create free account
3. Get your form endpoint
4. Update `about.html` form action:
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

**Netlify Forms (If using Netlify):**
- Already set up! Just add `data-netlify="true"` to form tag

### 4. **Connect Real Appointment Scheduler**

**Calendly Integration:**
```javascript
// In sarah-ai.js, update selectTimeSlot():
window.open('https://calendly.com/yourusername/demo', '_blank');
```

**Or build custom scheduler** with Google Calendar API or similar

### 5. **Add Analytics** (Optional)

Add Google Analytics to track visitors:
```html
<!-- Add to <head> of each page -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
